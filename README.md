## Intro
This is a simple chrome extension that I was motivated to make because LinkedIn does not provide a way to filter job listings directly by years of experience. They do have rough experience level groupings set up, so you can filter by terms like "Entry Level" or Mid-Senior Level", but these terms are not sufficiently detailed because "Mid-Senior Level" could mean 3 years or 10+. In order to make it a bit easier for job seekers to look through search results, I thought it may be helpful to have a program run on Chome (an extension) which provided some visual information display (I am currently unsure exactly what the output will look like) which tells them immediately how many years of experience a job description desires.

If you have any suggestions for improvements, please reach out to me at w.marino997@gmail.com.
